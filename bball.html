   <h2 id="header2">The main dates from life of Steph Curry</h2>

    <section id="list-text">
    <ul id="unorder-list">
      <li><strong>1988</strong> Stephen Curry was born on March 14, 1988. He is the son of Sonya and Dell Curry. He was born in Akron, Ohio, at Summa Akron City Hospital (it's the same hospital where other great basketball player LeBron James had been born 3 years earlier)</li>
      <li><strong>2009</strong> On June 25, 2009 Stephen Curry is picked 7th overall in the 2009 NBA draft. The Golden State Warriors selected the best shooter of his generation.</li>
      <li><strong>2011</strong> On July 11 Stephan Curry married Ayesha Curry. He married his high school sweetheart.</li>
      <li><strong>2012</strong> On July 19 Stephen Curry found something more important than practicing basketball. His family was growing. As his Daughter Riley is born.</li>
      <li><strong>2013</strong> Curry showed Knicks fans they were right to be frustrated when he didn't fall to New York on draft night. Even though the Warriors lost, Steph posted a career-high 54 points. He shot 18-for-28 from the field and knocked down 11-of-13 3-point attempts, falling just one three shy of tying what was then the NBA record. In this same season, he broke the record for 3s made in a season burying 272 shots from deep - a record he would later destroy three more times.</li>
      <li><strong>2015</strong> Steph Curry is voted MVP of the Golden State Wariors on May 4th 2015 as him and Wilt Camberlin being the only MVP's on The Warriors.</li>
      </li><strong>2015</strong> Stephen Curry wins his first NBA Championship with the Golden State Warriors against the Clevland Caveliers on game 6. Game six was held on June 16.</li>
    <li><strong>2015</strong> On July 10, 2015 Ryan Curry was born. Winning the NBA finals last month was big, but this is even bigger. Going to be tough for the girls to carry on the family legacy in the NBA, but who knows.</li>
    <li><strong>2016</strong> Stephen Curry get's his second MVP award after his phenomenal performance on thar year. In 2016 also Golden State Wariorrs breaks Chicago Bulls record on most winning regular matches into one season. Previous record was 72-10 and Michel Jordan's Chicago Bulls owned it, but after Stephen Curry's phenomenal season Golden State Wariors made 73-9 record.He becomes the first person to be named Most Valuable Player by unanimous vote in NBA history.</li>
    <li><strong>2017</strong> After blowing a 3-1 lead in 2016, the NBA fans and media were all over Golden State all season long. With a 3-1 lead in the 2017 Finals, it was crucial that the Warriors closed out Game 5 at home to silence any opportunity for LeBron and Cavs to complete another comeback. Curry stepped up to the task, finishing the game with 34 points and 10 assists on the night to secure the Warriors second championship in three years. Curry was not awarded with the Finals MVP due to the success that his newest teammate Kevin Durant had, but his 26.8 points, 9.4 assists, 8.0 rebounds and 2.2 steals per game proved equally as vital in earning his second championship ring.</li>
    <li><strong>2018</strong> Goldens State Warriors and Stephen Curry Became NBA Champions one more time again, as They swept Cavaliers in 4 Game. In Game 2 of the NBA Finals, Curry hit a Finals-record nine 3-pointers and scored 33 points in a 122–103 win over the Cavaliers. In Game 4, Curry led all scorers with 37 points in a 108–85 win that helped the Warriors clinch their second straight championship with a series sweep over the Cavaliers. Many felt that he should have won Finals MVP. In response, Curry stated, "At the end of the day, I'm not going to let a [Finals] MVP trophy define my career. Three titles ... Wherever that puts us in the conversation in the history of the NBA ... I'm a three-time champ."</li>
